### Analysis 
We first compared the different genres of films with the worldwide revenue generated. This comparison is quite effective as it evaluates how specific genres perform across the globe.
Our analysis showed that:
- Drama and comedy have the highest worldwide gross revenue
- Comedy is a genre that appears most in the top ten genres with the highest worldwide gross
- Comedy Musical and Performing Arts is the least of the top ten genres that are performing well in terms of worldwide gross

A strong positive linear relationship between production budget and the worldwide gross is visible.
This suggests that movies with higher production costs tend to have higher worldwide revenues. However this does not guarantee a higher production budget will lead to higher worldwide gross

#### Heartfelt genres like documentaries, family, and romance are preferred
